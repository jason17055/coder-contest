Coder Contest
=============

Coder Contest is a web-based application (designed to run on Google App
Engine) that is used to administer computer programming contests. It
allows people to sign in, access one or more computer programming
problems, type code to solve the problem, test their solution, and submit
the solution for judging. There is a separate judging interface, where
judges can login and review submissions and mark them correct or
incorrect. Finally, there is an automatic scoreboard interface which will
display the top-ranked contestants and how many points they have.
