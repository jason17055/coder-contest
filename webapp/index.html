hosting and judging programming contests.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create unique logons for each contestant/team and for each judge.</li>
<li>Your contest will have a scoreboard URL that anyone can see and
which automatically updates as scores change.</li>
<li>Problems can be distributed in-band (through the web interface)
or out-of-band (hardcopy packets given to the teams).</li>
<li>Contestants can request clarifications and judges can issue them.</li>
<li>Contestants can work on and test a solution through the web
interface before submitting it to the judges.</li>
<li>Solutions must be a single file but can be
C, C++, Java, C#, Python, Perl, or Ruby.
The contest director can limit which languages are actually accepted.</li>
<li>Solutions will run on a computer (or computers) at your site, so that
you can ensure that judging uses the same platform/environment as the
contestants have.</li>
<li>Judges can have one or more test files which each submission will
automatically be run on and the results displayed to the judges.</li>
</ul>
