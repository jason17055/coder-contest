* scoreboard: show time remaining in current round
* config option for "Write Code" tab
   - let director disable the "Write Code" tab for all contestants
      (I am worried that if teams write code online in the editor
       they might lose their work if they forget to click Save, or
       upload a different file on the Test/Submit tab.)
* programming language support
   - let director specify exactly which programming languages are
     supported.
* message acknowledgement:
   - when user clicked 'Dismiss' or 'Open' on a message,
     make sure the message is never displayed again, even if user
     logs into a different computer
* judges interface:
   - assign judges to problems or to teams
   - allow judge to change password
* allow group submissions (so that individuals can be tracked over
  a several-week contest where the teams change from week to week)
* problem-specific options:
   - start time, end time
   - unique icon for scoreboard
   - unique image for congratulations popup
   - specify runtime limit
* worker:
   - implement memory limit
   - implement output file size limit
* user interface:
   - allow contest to specify color scheme of all pages
      (e.g. Red for Dickinson)
* director dashboard:
   - show online/offline status of job runners (a.k.a. workers)
   - show current activity levels
* general notification architecture:
   - notify completion of a run
* schema fixups
   - rename 'team' table to 'user'
   - rename team.team_number column to 'user_id'
