--v1.2--
* listsubmissions:
   - refresh as soon as drop-down changes
* date/time fields (contest start time, phase end times)
   - separate date from time
   - use configured time zone
* scoreboard:
   - show time remaining in current round
   - prior to start of round, show an overlay with "Contest is starting in ##:##"
     which counts down and automatically disappears at 0:00

* differencer:
   - hilight differences within the line

--v1.3--
* large file uploads:
   - often unable to complete in 60 seconds, leading to Cancellation
* listsubmissions:
   - after stealing a submission, we lose which status was being filtered
   - after drilling down into test results, we lose status filter
* _admin/contests: show when contest was last accessed, number of problems, etc.
* broker startup: when initiating a broker startup, schedule a task
  that will run a minute later to check whether the broker heartbeat has
  occurred and if not, try to start it up again. (This may be necessary in
  the case that a broker startup occurs while the broker is still shutting
  down.)
* problem deletion: delete any corresponding Result entities as well
* system test deletion: delete any corresponding test results as well

   - do not show a bogus username if user is already logged in to a different
     contest

* implement a garbage collector
   - delete files and file chunks that are no longer referenced
   - delete old jobs
   - etc.
* if non-contestant opens a problem without a description, and the code
  editor has been disabled, the user sees the Submit page which should not be
  allowed
* controller: show correct numbers for judges' submission counts

--future--

    results for all existing submissions of the problem

* controller: allow sorting by team name or score

--OLD--
* message acknowledgement:

     logs into a different computer
* judges interface:
   - assign judges to problems or to teams
   - allow judge to change password
