     "Wrong Answer (multiple differences)"

--v1.3--
* large file uploads:
   - often unable to complete in 60 seconds, leading to Cancellation

   - after stealing a submission, we lose which status was being filtered
   - after drilling down into test results, we lose status filter
* _admin/contests: show when contest was created, last accessed,
  number of problems, etc.
* broker startup: when initiating a broker startup, schedule a task
  that will run a minute later to check whether the broker heartbeat has
  occurred and if not, try to start it up again. (This may be necessary in
  the case that a broker startup occurs while the broker is still shutting
  down.)
* problem deletion: delete any corresponding Result entities as well
* system test deletion: delete any corresponding test results as well

   - etc.

  editor has been disabled, the user sees the Submit page which should not be
  allowed

    results for all existing submissions of the problem
* define_contest: give list of all valid timezone names

* define_problem: make link to test the reference solution
* list_problems: implement "Download as Zip"
* controller: allow sorting by team name or score

--OLD--
* message acknowledgement:
   - when user clicked 'Dismiss' or 'Open' on a message,
